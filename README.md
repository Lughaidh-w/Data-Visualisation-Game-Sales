# Data Visualisation Game Sales
This project performs visualisation on vggames csv file, using static visualisations.

Some trends are explored in the data, as well as some predefined questions answered.

This project attempts to answer some questions in the data and present visualisations for each.
This project was initially submitted as part of my HDip in Data Analytics, and the questions are adapted from there.
